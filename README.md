# Daily Advice Web Page

This is a cute one page website where random advice is generated for users to enjoy (powered by Advice Slip API). 
The inspiration for this project came from softscienceprojects and the featured snow effect is from hcodes. 

This was a fun, little, quick project for me to do to gain an understanding in API's and their uses in addition to practising some web develpment/design skills. 
I had a lot of fun creating this and hope you will learn some cool advice for the day from visiting.
